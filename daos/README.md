To load and build the project properly, and to thus see our solution properly working, you will need to install dependencies in the terminal.

1. Make sure you're in the daos folder.
2. Open two terminals.
3. In the first one write cd backend (this will move you to the backend folder) _press enter_; and after that write npm i (to install all the backend dependencies). After the install is finished write npm run start:dev OR yarn start:dev (if you know that you have yarn install on your PC) - KEEP THE TERMINAL UP AND RUNNING !
4. Switch to the other terminal and write npm i _press enter_, after which you need to write npm run dev (for the website to open as a live view in the browser) - the link to the website will be written at the end as fx. Local: http://127.0.0.1:5173 (CTRL + click on the link to open it)
5. KEEP BOTH OF THE TERMINALS UP AND RUNNING FOR THE WEBSITE TO WORK PROPERLY.
